# SaltyBot SaltyBet Software

This project creates a saltybot that, once logged in, will determine the most likely winner and place a 5-10% of total money as a bet. It uses ELO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) as the algorithm to determining the most likely winner - useful for fighters that have never faced each other prior.

## Features

* All output is displayed in the console
* Details are also archived into a results.json file at the root level for later analysis

## To-Do

Future major enhancements and larger projects:

* Build data analysis on results using pandas
* Build Web UI for Raspberry Pi touchscreen (using Flask?)
